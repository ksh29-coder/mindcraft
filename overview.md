# Mindcraft Project Overview

## Project Objective

Mindcraft is an open-source framework that connects large language models (LLMs) to Minecraft Java Edition. It enables AI agents to interact with and perform tasks in the Minecraft world using natural language. The project creates a bridge between advanced AI capabilities and the sandbox game environment, allowing LLM-powered agents to navigate, build, craft, and interact with players and the world autonomously.

## Core Functionality

Mindcraft allows users to:
- Deploy AI agents into Minecraft that can understand and respond to natural language
- Configure multiple agents with different LLM backends
- Enable agents to perform complex tasks through commands or self-directed goals
- Allow agents to learn from examples and retain memory of past interactions
- Optionally enable code generation for more complex behaviors
- Support multi-agent scenarios where AI agents can interact with each other

### Key Components

1. **Agent System**
   - `agent.js`: Core agent implementation that handles message processing, command execution, and state management
   - `action_manager.js`: Manages agent actions and behaviors
   - `conversation.js`: Handles conversations between agents and players
   - `modes.js`: Implements different behavior modes for agents
   - `vision/`: Provides vision capabilities for agents to interpret the game world

2. **LLM Integration**
   - `models/`: Contains implementations for various LLM providers:
     - OpenAI (GPT models)
     - Google (Gemini models)
     - Anthropic (Claude models)
     - Mistral
     - Replicate
     - Ollama (local models)
     - Qwen
     - Groq
     - HuggingFace
     - Novita
     - DeepSeek
     - XAI (Grok)
     - Hyperbolic
     - GLHF
     - OpenRouter

3. **Agent Profiles**
   - JSON-based configuration files that define:
     - LLM models to use for different functions (chat, coding, vision, embedding)
     - System prompts for different contexts
     - Example conversations and behaviors
     - Default behavior modes

4. **Command System**
   - Extensive set of commands that agents can use to interact with the Minecraft world
   - Commands for movement, building, crafting, combat, and more
   - Special `!newAction` command that allows for code generation and execution

5. **Memory and Learning**
   - Embedding-based example selection for relevant context
   - Memory persistence across sessions
   - Skill library for reusable code functions

## How It Works

### Initialization Process

1. The application starts by loading the `settings.js` configuration
2. It initializes the mind server if enabled
3. It parses command-line arguments for profile paths and task information
4. For each profile, it creates a new agent process
5. Each agent process:
   - Loads the profile configuration
   - Initializes the LLM models (chat, code, vision, embedding)
   - Connects to the Minecraft server
   - Sets up event handlers for game events
   - Initializes the agent's behavior modes

### Agent Interaction Flow

1. **Message Handling**:
   - Messages from players are received through the Minecraft chat
   - Messages are translated to English if needed
   - Messages are added to the agent's history
   - The agent generates a response using its LLM

2. **Command Execution**:
   - If the agent's response contains a command (e.g., `!collectBlocks`), it is executed
   - Commands can control movement, building, crafting, and other actions
   - Command results are added to the agent's history

3. **Code Generation** (when enabled):
   - The `!newAction` command allows the agent to write JavaScript code
   - The code is executed in a sandboxed environment
   - The code has access to the Mineflayer bot API and custom utility functions

4. **Vision Capabilities** (when enabled):
   - Agents can interpret screenshots of their view
   - Vision information is processed by vision-capable LLMs
   - This allows agents to understand and describe what they see

5. **Multi-Agent Interaction**:
   - Agents can communicate with each other through the chat system
   - Special handling prevents agents from hallucinating responses from other agents
   - Conversations between agents are managed by the conversation system

### LLM Integration

The project uses a modular approach to LLM integration:

1. Each LLM provider has its own implementation file (e.g., `gpt.js`, `claude.js`)
2. The `prompter.js` file handles:
   - Selecting the appropriate LLM based on the profile configuration
   - Constructing prompts with relevant context
   - Managing cooldowns between requests
   - Handling different types of prompts (conversation, coding, vision, etc.)

3. Embedding models are used for:
   - Selecting relevant examples for the current context
   - Enabling more efficient memory and learning capabilities

- **Mind Server**: Configuration for the UI server
- **Agent Profiles**: Which profiles to load
- **Security Settings**: Code execution permissions, vision capabilities
- **Behavior Settings**: Memory loading, chat behavior, language settings
- **Performance Settings**: Context window size, example count, command limits

## Security Considerations

The project includes several security features and warnings:

- Code execution is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled
- When enabled, code runs in a sandboxed environment but remains vulnerable to potential injection attacks
- Docker container support is provided for additional isolation
- Warning against connecting to public servers with code execution enabled

## Deployment Options

The project supports multiple deployment scenarios:

- **Local Development**: Running on localhost with a local Minecraft instance
- **Online Servers**: Connecting to remote Minecraft servers using Microsoft authentication
- **Docker Container**: Running in an isolated container for improved security
- **ViaProxy**: Support for connecting to unsupported Minecraft versions

## Conclusion

Mindcraft represents a sophisticated integration of large language models with Minecraft, creating an accessible platform for AI agents to interact with a complex virtual world. The project's modular design, extensive configuration options, and support for multiple LLM providers make it a versatile framework for experimentation, education, and entertainment in the intersection of AI and gaming.
